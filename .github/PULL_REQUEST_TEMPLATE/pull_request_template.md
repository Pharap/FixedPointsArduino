**Important**

_Please do not create a pull request unless you have created an appropriate issue, discussed the issue with the authors/maintainers and received the explicit approval of the library's authors/maintainers to provide a bug fix or feature implementation._

_Creating pull requests without adequately discussing the situation with the authors/maintainers is likely to get your pull request closed._

_This rule is in place to ensure that all issues are properly discussed, evaluated and agreed upon._
